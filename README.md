# Quavatar
A tool for PNG tubers.

## Disclaimer
This project is in a such an early state that it doesn't even have the most basic features you would expect,
the only reason this repo exists by now is to document the development.

## How to use
Add a folder called `imgs` to the same directory as the executable,
inside of it put one image for when you are talking and one for when you are not talking
called `idle.png` and `speaking.png` respectively.

## How to build
You will need [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) in order to build this.
```console
$ ./build.sh
$ ./quavatar
```
